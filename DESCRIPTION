Description: This package includes two main functions: 1. dropmodel that fits a logistic regression model for the drop-out or missingness model for estimating and computing the inverse probability censoring weights; and 2) ipccwGEE to fit a marginal model with cluster-weights and inverse probability censoring weights for binary outcomes using the method of generalized estimating equations.
